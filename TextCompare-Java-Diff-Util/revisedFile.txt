C does not support call by reference

C does not support call by reference. Because when you pass pointer then you are passing the 
address of the variable which is actually a value.

If a language is pass by reference, then there are no different ways of passing the argument – 
you pass an argument and a reference is sent to the function – there are no syntactical 
differences between passing by value and passing by reference. 

However, in C, when the intent is to pass by reference, then we change the syntax a bit – xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

So, pointers is a tool to simulate/emulate call by reference, but the language as such 
does not _naturally_ support call by reference. So, C is strictly call by value and not by reference.
