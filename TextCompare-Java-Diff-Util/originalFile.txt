C does not support call by reference

C does not support call by reference. Because when you pass pointer then you are passing the 
address of the variable which is actually a value.

If a language is pass by reference, then there are no different ways of passing the argument – 
you pass an argument and a reference is sent to the function – there are no syntactical 
differences between passing by value and passing by reference. 

However, in C, when the intent is to pass by reference, then we change the syntax a bit – 
that is we don't pass the variable anymore, but pass the address of it. Technically speaking, 
the address is still _copied_ to the parameter of the function and we use that _copied_ 
address to dereference it and get the value stored at the address. 

So, pointers is a tool to simulate/emulate call by reference, but the language as such 
does not _naturally_ support call by reference. So, C is strictly call by value and not by reference.
